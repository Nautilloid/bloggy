## About Me

Hi, I’m Nautilloid — a hands-on IT student and aspiring security researcher based in Melbourne. I’m currently studying Information Technology with a focus on systems administration, web security, and ethical hacking.

I’ve built this site to share my write-ups from Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, security labs like PortSwigger, and the technical work I’m doing in my home lab. The blog is entirely self-hosted, running on an Ubuntu server in a Proxmox container, served securely via Nginx — because I believe in building things from the ground up.

I'm especially interested in roles related to:
- Penetration Testing
- IT support & systems administration
- InfoSec & vulnerability analysis
- DevSecOps and automation
- Threat detection or red teaming

I'm currently looking for entry-level opportunities or internships where I can grow with a team, contribute to real-world projects, and keep sharpening my technical skills.

If you’re hiring or just want to connect, feel free to contact me via ``` nautilloid@proton.me```

Kia kaha — thanks for stopping by.
